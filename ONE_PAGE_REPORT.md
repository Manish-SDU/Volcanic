# VOLCANIC

## I. INTRODUCTION

**Motivation:** We just love volcanoes, nothing more to it.

**Project:** It is a web app for volcano explorers, where u can earn badges, and discover new volcanic sites.

**Contributions:** Responsive design, CSS animations, JavaScript interactions, and accessibility features?

## II. FRONTEND DESIGN

### HTML Structure

- `<header>` - Navigation with animated lava bubbles
- `<nav>` - Main menu with ARIA labels  
- `<main>` - Core content (carousel, profiles, stats)
- `<section>` - Content groups (hero, stats, achievements)
- `<footer>` - Site info and links

Pages use consistent layout: nav header, main content, footer.

### CSS Styling

**Layout:** CSS Grid for page structure, Flexbox for navigation and buttons.

**Colors:** Volcanic theme with orange (#FF6F15), gold (#F8B259), and beige (#F3E9DC) backgrounds.

**Fonts:** Google Fonts - Inter for text, Poppins for headings.

**Effects:** Hover animations, lava bubble effects, smooth transitions.

**Mobile:** Media queries for phones (480px), tablets (768px), and desktops (1440px+).

### JavaScript Features

1. **Carousel** - Auto-rotating volcano images with manual controls
2. **Search** - Text changes as user types with smooth animations  
3. **Stats** - Numbers count up from 0 when page loads
4. **Panels** - Switch between visited/wishlist volcanoes
5. **Profile** - Toggle locked achievements visibility
6. **Volcano Animation** - React-based volcanoe image for user-interaction and engagement.

## III. USER EXPERIENCE

**Navigation:** Stays consistent across pages. Logo and bubbles add visual appeal.

**Accessibility:** Screen reader support, keyboard navigation, proper contrast, ARIA labels.

**Interaction:** Animated stats show progress, carousel reveals destinations, volcanoes cards and map to provide information.

**Mobile:** Layout adapts to all screen sizes, buttons resize, content adjust properly.

## CHATGPTTTT

We used AI in our UI design to improve our understanding of HTML, CSS, and JS. By practicing course exercises and asking it how visuals or user interactions could be improved, we learned how to refine code and apply that knowledge to our project, without using AI directly to generate the code, but to get some ideas, that the group implemented.
